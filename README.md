# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains the code and projects from my Python learning journey.

## Day 1: Introduction to Programming

On Day 1, I focused on understanding the basics of programming and setting up the development environment. The first step is always the most important, and I am excited to continue the journey ahead!

## How to use this repo:
- Navigate through the folders for different days and projects.
- Each day's content will have both theory and practice exercises.
